Aqueduct is a blender addon that strives to make the appending/linking and saving
of 3D assets to an Asset Library fast and comfortable. It features a custom context
menu (shown below) for when you drop .blend-files  on the viewport and the ability
to save Materials, Objects and Collections to their own files and render preview
thumbnails automatically.
